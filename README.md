# Prediction_ML
The objective is to predict the possibility of becoming a client if you come to inquire at an insurance broker.
I put several machine learning algorithms in a run_classifiers function to choose the one with the best score and then I improved 
the parameters of my best classifier and I finally had a score of 99.38%.

it is a supervised classification problem and the target variable has two classes (yes or no) so we can use algorithms that work in this kind of problem such as logistic regression.

the algorithms tested to make the prediction are: RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, MLPClassifier, BaggingClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier and GaussianNB.
