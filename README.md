# Prediction_ML
The objective is to predict the possibility of becoming a client if you come to inquire at an insurance broker.
I put several machine learning algorithms in a run_classifiers function to choose the one with the best score and then I improved 
the parameters of my best classifier and I finally had a score of 99.38%.
